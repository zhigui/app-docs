# Privacy Policy

ZhiguiChen built the MoodPress app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by ZhiguiChen and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the App.

I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at MoodPress unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## TrueDepth API

We utilize the TrueDepth camera system on your device to track the movement of your mouth, brows, cheeks, and jaw, allowing you to recognize your facial expressions when creating a mood entry. To enable this functionality, the app needs access to your device's camera, which you can toggle on or off at any time in your device's settings.

Please note that the Application does not collect, store, or share any data used by the TrueDepth API. The processing of the information collected through the TrueDepth Camera API is performed exclusively on your device. This information will never leave your device or be shared with any third parties.

## No Data will be collected

For a better experience, while using our Service, the information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

The app doesn't collect any information used to identify you. If you have opted-in to share anonymized information with app developers in the iOS settings, we will receive anonymized usage statistics from Apple.

## Security
The Application does not provide an option to create an account therefore, we do not store nor have access to your entries and data. Your data are stored only locally on your device and all calculations are done on your device as well. You can optionally export your data to stored in your private space and we donâ€™t have access to your backup files.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
