## TrueDepth API

We use the device's TrueDepth camera system to track the movement of your mouth, brow, cheek, and jaw. This allows you to recognize the mood of your face when creating a mood entry. In order for this functionality to be possible, the app requires access to your device's camera. This access can be toggled on or off at any time in your device's settings.
The Application does not collect, store or share data used by TrueDepth API. The processing of information collected through the TrueDepth Camera API will be performed exclusively on the device. This information will never leave the device or shared with any third parties.
