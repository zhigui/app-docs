# Privacy Policy

ZhiguiChen built the Water+ app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by ZhiguiChen and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the App.

I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Water+ unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## No Data will be collected

For a better experience, while using our Service, the information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

The app doesn't collect any information used to identify you. If you have opted-in to share anonymized information with app developers in the iOS settings, we will receive anonymized usage statistics from Apple.

## Security
Your water / caffeine intake is securely stored in Appleâ€™s encrypted Health app and your preferences settings is saved on your private iCloud.
