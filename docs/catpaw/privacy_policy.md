# Privacy Policy

ZhiguiChen ("us", "we", or "our") operates the CatPaw iOS mobile application (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data. By using the CatPaw, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

We do not collect any personally identifiable information from users of our Service. As an independent developer, we prioritize user privacy.

If you choose to use the AI functionality provided by the Third-party Ai Service, you, as a user, will be required to manually input your Api key and other necessary configurations. The input data from users utilizing the AI features will be sent to Third-party AI servers, and CatPaw does not collect or store any of this information.

Users have the ability to create personalized AI commands based on their preferences and needs. These custom commands and associated records will be stored only on the user's local device, providing an individualized and secure experience.

**Use of Data**

Our app offers the AI Commands iCloud Sync feature, providing seamless command synchronization across all your devices. When you enable this option, your personalized AI commands are securely transferred and stored in the iCloud account linked to your Apple ID. We prioritize your privacy and exercise the utmost care to protect your data. The iCloud Sync feature harnesses Apple's robust encryption protocols to safeguard your commands during transmission and storage. By utilizing this feature, you agree to the synchronization of this data, aligning with our commitment to uphold Apple's stringent privacy standards. Rest assured, your AI commands remain confidential and are only accessible by devices authenticated under your Apple ID. We do not share your data with third parties, nor do we have access to the content of your synchronized AI commands.

The data collected by OpenAI during the use of AI features is subject to OpenAI's privacy policy. Users are encouraged to review OpenAI's policies, which can be found at OpenAI Privacy Policies, for a comprehensive understanding of how their data is handled: [OpenAi Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

The data collected by Google Gemini during the use of AI features is subject to the [Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms) and the [Generative AI APIs Additional Terms of Service](https://ai.google.dev/terms), and [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). **Please notice that don't submit sensitive, confidential, or personal information to the APIs.** Human reviewers may read, annotate, and process your API input and output. Google takes steps to protect your privacy as part of this process, including disconnecting this data from your Google Account or API key before reviewers see or annotate it.

**Security**

We value your trust in providing your data, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Keyboard Full Access**

To utilize the networking features of the keyboard extension, users must enable the "Allow Full Access" option in their device settings. This is necessary for the proper functioning of the AI features.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
